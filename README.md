# Movie_Recommendation_System

This repository contains a movie recommendation system built using machine learning techniques. It leverages TF-IDF Vectorizer to transform movie descriptions into numerical vectors, Cosine Similarity to measure the similarity between these vectors, and Difflib to enhance text matching. The system efficiently recommends movies to users based on the similarity of their descriptions, providing personalized suggestions by analyzing the textual content of the movie database.
